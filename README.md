# Personal CRM

This project is a small but feature-rich personal CRM. It's written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), using [Remix](https://remix.run/), [React.js](https://react.dev/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). I've deployed this project on [Fly.io](https://fly.io/).

## Get started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/m-zelinka/personal-crm.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Define required env variables:

   - Copy the template contents in [.env.example](.env.example) to a new file named `.env` and fill all the required fields.

4. Run the application in dev mode:

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## Goals

Practice working with Remix [data loadings APIs](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/guides/data-loading) and [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/).
